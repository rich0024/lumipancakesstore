# 🚀 Cloudinary + PostgreSQL Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Cloudinary for image storage and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Cloudinary Account** (Free tier available)
2. **Railway Account** (for PostgreSQL database)
3. **Your deployed app** (already working)

## 🖼️ Step 1: Set Up Cloudinary

### 1.1 Create Cloudinary Account
1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email

### 1.2 Get Your Cloudinary Credentials
1. Go to your Cloudinary Dashboard
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Cloud Name**
   - **API Key**
   - **API Secret**

### 1.3 Add to Railway Environment Variables
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   ```

## 💾 Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL Database

### 2.1 Add PostgreSQL to Railway
1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
3. Wait for the database to be created
4. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` from the database service

### 2.2 Add Database URL to Environment Variables
1. Go to your backend service in Railway
2. Add this environment variable:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
   ```
   (Use the actual URL from step 2.1)

## 🔧 Step 3: Deploy the Updated Code

### 3.1 Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Cloudinary and PostgreSQL support"
git push origin main
```

### 3.2 Railway will automatically:
- Install the new dependencies (`cloudinary` and `pg`)
- Run the database migrations
- Start the updated server

## ✅ Step 4: Verify Setup

### 4.1 Check Database Connection
1. Go to your Railway backend logs
2. Look for: `Connected to PostgreSQL database`

### 4.2 Test Image Upload
1. Go to your admin panel
2. Try uploading an image
3. Check that it uploads to Cloudinary (not local storage)

### 4.3 Check Data Persistence
1. Add some photocards/prints
2. Restart your Railway service
3. Verify data is still there

## 🎯 Benefits You'll Get

### ✅ **Image Storage:**
- **CDN Delivery**: Fast image loading worldwide
- **Automatic Optimization**: Images resized automatically
- **No Storage Limits**: 25GB free storage
- **Reliable**: Images never lost

### ✅ **Database:**
- **Data Persistence**: Data survives server restarts
- **ACID Compliance**: Reliable transactions
- **Scalability**: Can handle growth
- **Backups**: Automatic backups

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- Ensure PostgreSQL service is running in Railway
- Check Railway logs for connection errors

### Cloudinary Upload Issues
- Verify all three Cloudinary environment variables
- Check Cloudinary dashboard for upload logs
- Ensure images are under 5MB

### Migration Issues
- Check Railway logs for migration errors
- Verify database permissions
- Try running migrations manually if needed

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway logs first
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Test each service individually
4. Check Cloudinary and Railway documentation

## 🎉 Next Steps

Once everything is working:
1. **Add Real Images**: Replace placeholder images with actual photocard images
2. **Set Up Monitoring**: Add error tracking and performance monitoring
3. **Optimize**: Add caching and performance optimizations
4. **Scale**: Consider upgrading to paid tiers as you grow
